[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-%23FE5196?logo=conventionalcommits&logoColor=white)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

Bash script to [compose packets](https://github.com/yertto/kodi_event/blob/main/bin/kodi_event_packet) and [send](https://github.com/yertto/kodi_event/blob/main/bin/kodi_event_send) them to a [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) instance running an [Event Server](https://kodi.wiki/view/EventServer).

Its only dependency is the [xxd](https://manpages.org/xxd) command.

(which is usually packaged with [vim-common](https://packages.debian.org/sid/vim-common) so should be widely available)

## Background
It is a re-write in bash of the [xbmcclient.py](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/5ec39d778c6b62e3a229f6a20ebd4e4aa96ecead/tools/EventClients/lib/python/xbmcclient.py) python library included in Kodi.
> Implementation of XBMC's UDP based input system.
>
> A set of classes that abstract the various packets that the event server
> currently supports. In addition, there's also a class, XBMCClient, that
> provides functions that sends the various packets

NB. Kodi _also_ allows control via it's [JSON-RPC API](https://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API).
> JSON-RPC is a HTTP- and/or raw TCP socket-based interface for communicating with Kodi. It replaces the deprecated HTTP API.

However this tool is using a _third_ way to control Kodi - the [EventServer](https://kodi.wiki/view/EventServer)
> The EventServer in Kodi was created to satisfy a need to support many input devices across multiple hardware platforms. Adding direct support for a multitude of devices generally decreases performance and stability, and becomes difficult to maintain. The EventServer was created to provide a simple, reliable way to communicate with and control Kodi.

A quick and easy way to tell clients apart is to look for the port number they use to connect to Kodi.
 * JSON-RPC API clients communicate with Kodi using TCP on port `9090`
 * EventServer clients communicate with Kodi using UDP on port `9777`

## Getting Started

This (and any other Event Client) requires Kodi to be configured to [allow remote control from applications on other systems](https://kodi.wiki/view/Settings/Services/Control#Allow_remote_control_from_applications_on_other_systems).

### Installation:
```
git clone git@github.com:yertto/event_client.git ~/Code/event_client
export PATH="$HOME/Code/event_client/bin:$PATH"
```

## Motivation

[Home Assistant - Kodi](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/kodi) ([View Source](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/kodi)) is a Home Assistant integration to control a [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) multimedia system.

However I wanted to use Kodi's [Event Server](https://kodi.wiki/view/EventServer) so I could use button events to drive the UI and Home Assistant integration didn't appear to do that.

In particular I want to send `Left` and `Right` button events so I can use the [Skip Steps](https://kodi.wiki/view/Skip_steps) to incrementally skip.

I only found one alternative that would connect to the Event Server.

However to run as a script in my Home Assistant it needs to be able to run with the *very* minimal resources used by [BusyBox](https://busybox.net)
> BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any small or embedded system.

So I made this tool to work _just_ using `bash` & BusyBox's version of `xxd`.

(And remarkably enough, it appears to achieve everything the python library does.)


## Testing
The tests can be run with:
 * `make test`

These tests make "[golden test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test)" assertions against pre-created binary packets.

The packets have been manually tested and confirmed to work against Kodi [v20.1-Nexus](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/tree/20.1-Nexus)

ie. by running:
 * `cat shpecs/support/NOTIFICATION/10chars_with_title.bin | EVENT_SERVER_HOST=$kodi_host kodi_event_send`
 * `cat shpecs/support/BUTTON/R1-info.bin                  | EVENT_SERVER_HOST=$kodi_host kodi_event_send`

Or run interactively using:
 * `kodi_event-test_menu`

Where the "golden" pre-created binary packets can be re-created using `uid=1700610725` and checked to have stayed unchanged with `diff` & `xxd`

eg. when a `diff` of their `xxd` hexdumps produces no difference... 
 * `diff -u <(xxd < shpecs/support/LOG/10chars.bin) <(uid=1700610725 pt=LOG kodi_event_packet "$(printf "X%.0s" {1..10})" | xxd)`
  
Or sent to Kodi using the generic `kodi_event` command setting a different packet type (`pt`) for each event type:
 * `            pt=BUTTON       kodi_event escape`
   * along with other button names for the default `map_name=KB` found in [keyboard.xml](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/5ec39d778c6b62e3a229f6a20ebd4e4aa96ecead/system/keymaps/keyboard.xml)
 * `map_name=XG pt=BUTTON       kodi_event dpadleft`
    * along with other button names for `map_name=XG` found in [gamepad.xml](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/5ec39d778c6b62e3a229f6a20ebd4e4aa96ecead/system/keymaps/gamepad.xml)
 * `map_name=R1 pt=BUTTON       kodi_event mymusic`
    * along with other button names for `map_name=R1` found in [remote.xml](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/5ec39d778c6b62e3a229f6a20ebd4e4aa96ecead/system/keymaps/remote.xml)
 * `code=11     pt=BUTTON       kodi_event`
    * will send the button with code `"11"` 
 * `            pt=NOTIFICATION kodi_event hello world`
 * `icon=shpecs/support/ha.png pt=NOTIFICATION kodi_event hello world with an icon`
 * `            pt=LOG          kodi_event hello logs`
   
Or there's also convenience scripts that pass in the `pt` type to `kodi_event`:
 * `kodi-helo                    ` # equavilent to `pt=HELO         kodi_event            `
 * `kodi-button       escape     ` # equavilent to `pt=BUTTON       kodi_event escape     `
 * `kodi-notification hello world` # equavilent to `pt=NOTIFICATION kodi_event hello world`
 * `kodi-log          hello logs ` # equavilent to `pt=LOG          kodi_event hello logs `
 * `kodi-ping                    ` # equavilent to `pt=PING         kodi_event            `
 * `kodi-bye                     ` # equavilent to `pt=BYE          kodi_event            `
   
Nb. all these commands require an `EVENT_SERVER_HOST` env var pointing at the Kodi instance.

(Or `BROADCAST=255.255.255.255` to broadcast to _all_ running Kodi instances.)

eg.
 * `BROADCAST=255.255.255.255 kodi-notification hello all kodi instances`
